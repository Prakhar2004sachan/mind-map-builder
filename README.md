# 🧠 Mind Map with React Flow

A fully interactive and customizable **Mind Map** application built using [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/). Designed for visual thinkers, students, and developers to create, connect, and manage ideas in a structured and intuitive way.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Drag-and-drop nodes with smooth interaction  
- ✅ Create, delete, and edit mind map nodes  
- ✅ Connect nodes with edges  
- ✅ Pan & Zoom support  
- ✅ Real-time layout updates  
- ✅ Custom node components (optional)  
- ✅ Built with performance and scalability in mind

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) *(optional if used)*
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or Create React App *(depending on your setup)*

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-flow-mindmap.git
cd react-flow-mindmap
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```
npm run dev  # For Vite
# or
npm start    # For Create React App
```


📁 Folder Structure

  └── styles/           # Global styles (if any)

```

🧩 How it Works
Nodes are rendered using React Flow's <ReactFlow /> component.

Edges represent logical or conceptual relationships.

State is managed using React’s useState, useReducer, or Context API (if implemented).

Users can drag nodes around, create new ones, connect edges, and manage layout visually.
