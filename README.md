- ✅ Real-time layout updates  
- ✅ Custom node components (optional)  
- ✅ Built with performance and scalability in mind

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) *(optional if used)*
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or Create React App *(depending on your setup)*

🧩 How it Works
Nodes are rendered using React Flow's <ReactFlow /> component.

Edges represent logical or conceptual relationships.

State is managed using React’s useState or context (if implemented).

You can drag nodes around and create edges interactively.
